# E4.Test3 is a WEB API application
It used an XML file as DB which can be found in the APP_Data folder
As required it has GET, POST and DELETE actions that havebeen implemented
I have used POSTMAN to test the application
You can find the Postman file used to test the different actions in the Postman folder
Please note that I have not implemented unit test here as i am using the same base as the E4.Test1 application
